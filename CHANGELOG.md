## Unreleased — 2026-08-07

### Fixes

- Fixed the title and header block duplicating (stacking up multiple copies) when the terminal was made narrower. The header is now cleared and repainted once per resize instead of being drawn on top of stale, reflowed rows.

## Unreleased — 2026-07-20

### Highlights

- Session browsing and resuming now follow Claude Code's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` convention, so the tool works with whichever profile you're actually running in instead of always reading the default `~/.claude/projects` — resuming a session lands you back in that same profile rather than the default one. ([7fdd383](https://github.com/kud/claude-sessions-cli/commit/7fdd383e1bf6cfd8c1605acb35e6d7bbb67c79ff))

### Fixes

- Fixed a leak where chats, labels, pins, and tags from every profile were listed together regardless of which profile was active — this state is now scoped per profile, matching the session data itself. ([7fdd383](https://github.com/kud/claude-sessions-cli/commit/7fdd383e1bf6cfd8c1605acb35e6d7bbb67c79ff))
- Unrecognised CLI flags are now rejected with an error instead of being silently swallowed and running the tool against the wrong data with no warning. ([7fdd383](https://github.com/kud/claude-sessions-cli/commit/7fdd383e1bf6cfd8c1605acb35e6d7bbb67c79ff))

### Internal

- Consolidated the README's preview screenshots into a single hero image and removed the unused `next`-tag publish workflow.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-23

### Highlights

- **Move session — folder browser replaces wizard** — pressing `M` on a session in the Code list now drops you straight into a live filesystem folder browser instead of a three-step wizard. Navigate with `↑↓`, `←` to go up a level, `→` to enter a subfolder, and `Enter` to confirm the destination. Folders that already contain Claude sessions are flagged with a dim `sessions` tag. Any directory is a valid target — it does not need to be an existing session folder. `+ New subfolder here…` and `+ Other path…` cover edge cases the browser cannot reach. The move rewrites the session's `cwd` throughout the conversation history and reconciles `~/.claude.json`, while warning about any embedded path references that are intentionally left untouched to avoid corrupting unrelated path prefixes.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **`--mock` flag** — run `claude-sessions --mock` to launch the TUI with a set of pre-populated fake sessions. Useful for screenshots, demos, and testing UI changes without needing real Claude history.
- **Preview screenshot** — `assets/preview.png` added and wired into the README and docs so visitors see what the TUI looks like immediately.

### Changed

- **README feature list** — expanded to surface recently shipped features: named sessions (`name · prompt` display), the named-only filter (`n`), move (`M`), rename (`r`), delete (`d`), and the correct `--resume`/`--continue`/`--name` flag behaviour on resume.
- **Install instruction simplified** — the docs no longer point to `@next`; the stable `@latest` tag is now the default install path (`npm install -g @kud/claude-sessions-cli`).
- **Homepage updated** — `package.json` homepage now points to `kud.io/projects/claude-sessions-cli` instead of the old GitHub Pages URL.
- **Docs quick-start trimmed** — removed the verbose ASCII-art session-browser example from the docs; the preview image replaces it with something more accurate and easier to maintain.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Session titles in the code tab** — sessions that have a saved title (set by Claude's `custom-title` event) now display it in **cyan** alongside the opening prompt. This makes it much easier to tell sessions apart at a glance without having to open them.
- **Named-only filter (`n`)** — press `n` while on the Code tab to toggle a filter that hides sessions without a title, leaving only the named ones. The current filter state is shown in the status bar and as a hint in the key legend. The filter resets automatically when you switch tabs.
- **Faster startup animation** — the intro sparkle sequence plays roughly twice as fast, reducing the perceived load time before the session list appears.

### Changed

- Session labels are now cleaned more aggressively before display: leading Markdown heading markers (`#`), list bullets (`-`, `*`, `+`), checkbox syntax (`[ ]`/`[x]`), and inline formatting (`*`, `_`, `` ` ``) are all stripped. This means prompts or titles that were authored in Markdown render as clean plain text rather than showing raw syntax.
- When both a title and a first-prompt are available and they differ, the label is displayed as **title · prompt**, giving you the context of the opening message alongside the session name.
- Manual label overrides (set via the rename wizard) now clear the stored `title` and `prompt` fields so the override is displayed without the dual-part format.
